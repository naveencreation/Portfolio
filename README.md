# My Portfolio Project

Hello guys! ðŸ‘‹ I am Naveen.

I have used only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** in this portfolio project. It's simple and quite good for a clean and straightforward appearance. I saw a similar template somewhere and decided to recreate it in my own way without using any fancy frameworks like React, Tailwind, or Bootstrap. I kept things as simple as possible.

Here is how it looks like:

Goodbye! ðŸ‘‹
